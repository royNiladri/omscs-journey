# 3 Months in Update <small>April 5, 2020</small>
Well, it's a lot of work! I really did not expect the projectcs to be so much work! The lectures are well structured. A lot of the things covered are present in the unofficial readling list books (I have been following OSTEP for the most part). The papers that accompany are a bit archaic, but definitely shed some light on how things worked, and why we have some of the things work the way they do now.

Okay, I guess I fastforwared a little. The course structure is as follows:

**Projects (3+ 1 extra credit)**|**40%**
**Mideterm**|**25%**
**Finals**|**30%**
**Participation**|**5%**

If you read other posts asking you to start the projects early, you better follow that. It really is a lot of work, and the midterm and final are woth more than one single project. Time management is crucial and you need to fail fast if you want to survive the smeseter.

With all these being said, if you have prior exposure to undegrad OS course and some advanced C programming skills up your sleeved, you should be able to sail across the course pretty comfortable.

***[P.S. : With  the onset of COVID-19 outbreak, the deadlines of project has been adjusted to allow a little more time. This is a trying time for everone and hope we comes out of it with minimum losses. For me motivation has definitely taken a hit! People dying in thousands every day, loss of job, unable to spend time with family - so much negetivity around. Hope we can overcome this in the coming couple of months.]***
