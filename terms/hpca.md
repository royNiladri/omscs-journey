# Recommended Prerequisites
While computer architecture and C++ are listed as basic prerequisites, having even basic fundamental knowledge is enough to get started. Most of the things required can be picked up during the course. One important thing is to be active on Piazza. From projects to quiz, there are couple of errata, and missing Piazza will be a nightmare. Also, the office hours are not recorded, so need to plan to attend if you are interested. The atmosphere is like a small classroom with a few people and Professor patiently explains and clarifies doubts.

# Project 0 <small>September 7, 2020</small>
Having two monitors or a printout of the instruction will help. You'll need to go through the project document and one or more Piazza posts regarding the same to understand the requirements and avoid confusion. It is not difficult, but definitely draining. You'll need to work on the provided VM, and it is based on Ubuntu 12, so no VS Code (I was heart broken when I discovered it after struggling to set it up for 2 hours). The default RAM, and CPU is less, and can be increased, and network can be enabled as well, but it is highly recommended to not upgrade the Ubuntu (because no one wants to risk getting different results than the one that will be tested upon), or C++ and accompanying libraries. Installing additional software is generally considered safe.

# Projects 1-3 & Midterm <small>November 25, 2020</small>
Projects 1 and 2 are significantly difficult and take time to complete. The disconnect between instructions and clarifications continue. You have to go through the FAQ thread and other student and instructor related follow ups on the project to get a clearer picture of the requirements and help. My partner for project 2 dropped and I had to pull it together at the last moment alone. I strongly recommend running benchmarks with your code changes to get some peace of mind (or the lack thereof). There are a lot of files to submit, so ensure you are not overwriting files from older simulation runs.

Project 3 is pretty much similar with respect to workload and inconsistent instructions. But having a dependable partner turned out to be life saver. The discussions in the group thread with Nolan (instructor) and my partner helped me course-correct my solution.

Midterm was tiring. It had a lot of calculations and by the end of an hour and half, I felt exhausted. I had a few minutes to spare at the end, but felt drained to revise. Of course I did not score above 90, but was not too far behind either. I think practising before the test will help speed up the calculations, and also get you back to the habit of number crunching for two hours straight.
