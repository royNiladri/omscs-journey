# Registration <small>January 4, 2020</small>
Boy was that stressful! As most of you would be aware that we new students have only the second phase to register. We got the time tickets on January 2nd and had a registration start time of 11 am ET on January 3rd. I was aware of the rush and had been checking up the available slots on oscar and Reddit. I wanted to get into GIOS and had as backup HCI and HPCA.

When the final moment of truth arrived, years of clicking and tabbing came to the rescue. Just before the registration started, GIOS had ~65 available spots. Click, click, click and my heart skipped a beat when I saw the table row, `**Registered (Web) on Jan 03, 2020`. I probably did my registration in under 30 seconds. I went back to check the status after 5 minutes, and waitlist number had crossed 75! Quite literally, "Every second counts".

As for payments, there are multiple options. I used Credit Card (because it's the simplest and happens immediately). Another popular option is the Flywire. On the official site I read, it might take up to 7 days for the payment to get processed and so did not seem like a feasible option for most people in their first term. Here is the breakdown of what I paid using Credit Card for one paper:

Transaction Component | USD (&#36;) | INR (&#8377;)
:--|--:|--:
Tuition Fees | 841.00| 59,978.44
PayPath Service Fees (2.85%) | 23.97 | 1,709.49
Currency Markup Fee | NA | TBD
**TOTAL** | **864.97** | **61,687.93**

Classes are supposed to start from **January 6th (Monday)**. Eagerly waiting for the next updates.

Well, it's a lot of work! I really did not expect the projectcs to be so much work! The lectures are well structured. A lot of the things covered are present in the unofficial readling list books (I have been following OSTEP for the most part). The papers that accompany are a bit archaic, but definitely shed some light on how things worked, and why we have some of the things work the way they do now.

Okay, I guess I fastforwared a little. The course structure is as follows:

**Projects (3+ 1 extra credit)**|**40%**
**Mideterm**|**25%**
**Finals**|**30%**
**Participation**|**5%**

If you read other posts asking you to start the projects early, you better follow that. It really is a lot of work, and the midterm and final are woth more than one single project. Time management is crucial and you need to fail fast if you want to survive the smeseter.

With all these being said, if you have prior exposure to undegrad OS course and some advanced C programming skills up your sleeved, you should be able to sail across the course pretty comfortable.

***[P.S. : With  the onset of COVID-19 outbreak, the deadlines of project has been adjusted to allow a little more time. This is a trying time for everone and hope we comes out of it with minimum losses. For me motivation has definitely taken a hit! People dying in thousands every day, loss of job, unable to spend time with family - so much negetivity around. Hope we can overcome this in the coming couple of months.]***
