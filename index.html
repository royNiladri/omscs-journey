<h1>Introduction</h1>
January 2020, I'm going to start my rollercoaster journey of persuing Masters of Science in Computer Science from the
renound Georgia Institute of Technology. Join me on this to find out where this takes us. Below you'll find the
courses that I take and my reviews and tips for the same. In the next section, "Blogs", I will document checkpoints
along the journey and will most likely be related to any course or term.

        <h1>Course List</h1>
        Here I'll list the courses that I take for a particular term. Visit each term to see the details. More details coming
        soon.

          {% assign terms = site.data.terms | where_exp: "term", "term.progress != 'Future'" %}
          {%  for term in terms %}
          <tr>
            <td>{{term.year}} {{ term.season }}</td>
            <td>
              {% for paper in term.papers %}
